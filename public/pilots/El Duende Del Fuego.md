--Excerpt from REDACTED incident report filed by Station Medical--



This unidentified* individual is an escapee from an illegal underground supersoldier experiment. It is unclear if these were the intended results, or if the experiments damaged his psyche in some way. Either way, this individual now believes himself to be something called a "Luchador," which is apparently part of some ancient historical wrestling culture.



*-Individual refuses to provide proper identification, and insists on being called "El Duende de Fuego"
