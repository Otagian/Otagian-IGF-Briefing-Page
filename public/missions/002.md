# Mission // #002
## Working Holiday



# Goals
- Ensure the security of the Icebreaker Borealis
- End any potential threats to its stability.

# Stakes
- If the Icebreaker Borealis shuts down, the system's main revenue stream will dry up.
- For us, that means the Gate's best customer will stop paying.

# Reserves
- See if you can weasel anything out of Rita.  You can take your stuff with you, too.
